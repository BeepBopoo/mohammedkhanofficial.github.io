			why I think I am an ideal candidate for the International Baccalaureate!</p>
		<h2>All About Me</h2>
			<p>Hey! How's your day going?</p>
			<br>
			<p>My name is Mohammed Khan. I am in grade 8 I will be graduating this year. I have a sibling who 
			is in grade 11 at VPCI, Her name is Safquat Khan. I am from a South Asian country named Bangladesh, I have many 
			favorite colors, but my top 3 are Cyan, Turquoise, and purple! I immigrated to Canada in 2015 when I was only 4 years 
			old! A lot has changed since then. Please continue reading and you will learn even MORE about me!<p>
			<br>
			<p>I like many sports such as soccer, basketball, and volleyball. I played on some sports teams when I was younger such as the Soccer team
 			and the basketball team. I have many hobbies. My hobbies include biking,
			fishing, drawing, and playing in general. (Casual soccer, Board games, and such.)</p>
			<br>
			<p>I have many other interests as well, However, I am most interested in Computer Sciences. This is because I find it 
			super fascinating! Everything is like a spiderweb. I love how Everything is  linked together and just falls into place if everything
			is done correctly. I also really like building computers and watching people build them. I am also interested in 
			Business. I like this field because it takes a lot of guts to be an entrepreneur. You have to try everything and persevere 
			until you get the right thing that you can do, and if it doesn't work you have to keep on persevering until it does, 
			which makes me feel like I always have something to keep me busy which is nice.</p>
			<br>
			<p> I also really like video games because they are a great way to learn a lot of things. I play A LOT of games, 
			but for your sake and mine, I will just name a few. 
			One of my favorites at the moment is Valorant. My second favorite is probably Brawlhalla. Both are action-packed and 
			are really fast-paced.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Hey, Thanks for reading about me! I hope you have a great day!</p>
